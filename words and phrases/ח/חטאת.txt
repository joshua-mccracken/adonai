חטאת

sin
a missing of the mark

genesis 4 7
יהוה confronts קין about his slaying of הבל and says to him that חטאת is lying in wait at the door like a beast of prey

genesis 31 36
יעקב confronts לבן about his pursuing him and asks what of his it is that made לבן chase after him

genesis 50 17
being scared of him, יוסף's brothers used their dead father to beseech יוסף for forgiveness for their transgression and sin because they did evil to him

exodus 5 16
בני ישראל complain to פרעה that while they are no longer given straw (or building material) the sin is with the people of פרעה

note that the sense of the final two words in this verse is difficult to translate. the word for sin could be the pa'al completed second person feminine singular of ח ט א (as the nikud shows), instead of a noun form
