chatat חטאת

sin
a missing of the mark

genesis 4:7
adonai confronts kayin about his slaying of hevel and says to him that chatat is lying in wait at the door like a beast of prey

genesis 31:36
ya'akov confronts lavan about his pursuing him and asks what of his it is that made lavan chase after him

genesis 50:17
being scared of him, yosef's brothers used their dead father to beseech yosef for forgiveness for their transgression and sin because they did evil to him

exodus 5:16
bnei yisrael complain to par'oh that while they are no longer given straw (or building material) the sin is with the people of par'oh

note that the sense of the final two words in this verse is difficult to translate. the word for sin could be the pa'al completed second person feminine singular of chata ח-ט-א (as the nikud shows), instead of a noun form
