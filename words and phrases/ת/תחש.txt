תחש

the meaning of this word is debated.

some connect it with an Arabic word meaning dolphin or porpoise. There are dolphins that live in the Red Sea. Apparently the Arabic word can refer to seals too, which did live around the Sinai Peninsula (not sure if they still do, can't find much info about that). The Sinai Peninsula juts out into the Red Sea, creating the Gulf of Suez and Gulf of Aqaba on either side. So seems reasonable to think seals could swim around and on to Sinai, giving people access to them.

others connect it with an Egyptian word meaning leather.

and others connect it with an Akkadian word meaning sheepskin.

basically, it definitely seems to refer to some sort of animal. The word תחש is generally used in conjunction with the Hebrew word עור, which means skin (as in human or animal, so also hide, leather etc.).

although, here is a curveball. Dolphins and seals aren't clean animals because they don't have scales (see Leviticus 11). So I don't think the Lord would have instructed them to use the skin of an unclean animal to build his dwelling place among them.

it would probably have to refer to some land creature. I did see references to animals like badgers (unclean because it doesn't have cloven hooves), zebras (also unclean because no cloven hooves), and giraffes (clean because chews cud and has cloven hooves).

so maybe it was a giraffe?

in any case, no one knows for sure and anyone who claims to know for sure is lying.
