teven תבן

straw
stubble
chaff

possibly this word is similar to tavneh תבנה and comes from the stem banah בנה, thus denoting building material rather than straw specifically

exodus 5 16
bnei yisrael complain to par'oh that while they are no longer given straw (or building material) the sin is with the people of par'oh

note that the sense of the final two words in this verse is difficult to translate, the word for sin could be the pa'al completed second person feminine singular of chata ח–ט–א (as the nikud shows), instead of a noun form
