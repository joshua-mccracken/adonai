[exodus 5:16]
bnei yisrael complain to par'oh that while they are no longer given straw (or building material) the sin is with the people of par'oh

note that the sense of the final two words in this verse is difficult to translate. the word for sin could be the pa'al completed second person feminine singular of chata ח-ט-א (as the nikud shows), instead of a noun form
