palal פ ל ל

underlying meaning of this root is to judge, to bring about justice, to prosecute

to judge oneself/to pray, hitpa'el

so, to pray is primarily to judge oneself before the lord, not asking for stuff
we can't ask adonai for a single thing until we have justified ourselves as being entitled to ask him
prayer is the seeking of justice
see genesis 18 and 19 and avraham's prayer to adonai for justice for sodom (first recorded prayer in scripture)
adonai answered avraham's prayer with justice. lot, his wife, and his two daughters were spared while the cities were destroyed
less than ten righteous were found, so the lord did not spare the whole city, but he did not sweep away the righteous with the wicked because he spared lot and his family
when we pray we must ask whether true justice will be served, not what I think I or someone else deserves
only adonai knows what true justice is, avraham didn't know because he kept reducing the number of righteous people
